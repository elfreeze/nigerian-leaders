      <p>He was born in the Northern Nigeria Protectorate (modern-day Bauchi State), in December 1912. He began his education at a Qur'anic School in Bauchi. He was later sent to Tafawa Balewa Elementary School after the Qur'anic School amongst a select few. Thereafter, he proceeded to Bauchi Provincial School. Like many of his contemporaries, he studied at Barewa College, then known as Katsina College, where he was student number 145. Ahmadu Rabah, later known as Ahmadu Bello, was student number 87 and was two years his senior, while Abubakar Imam was a year ahead of him.</p>
